# Object-Detection-GUI-using-YOLO-
This project implements a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for object detection using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) deep learning model. It allows users to open an image file and performs real-time object detection, displaying bounding boxes and labels for detected objects.
